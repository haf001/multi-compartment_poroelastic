# multi-compartment_poroelastic
The original poro-elastic python codes only functioned for single compartment scenarios where N = 1.

Some changes have been made to the problem.py file to enable solving for multi-compartment scenarios. The updated problem.py file is uploaded.

A demo_thesis.py file is uploaded to enable solving multi-compartment problems.

A demo_thesis.cfg file is also uploaded
